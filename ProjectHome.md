More to learn than to use.

I'm writing turn based rpg game engine , which will read all data ( in future most data) from text files.

Communication with end-user of game will be probably through window created with qt widgets.

Version 1.0 will be working version to play in window text based client.

Version 2.0 will be working version to play by simple graphic interface

Version 3.0 will be working version to play with full 2d graphic
